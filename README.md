# practice-nick-e

Hello! I'm from Merced CA, but i've lived in central Florida for most of my life. At SPIS I am hoping to get to know faculty and make friends with mentors and fellow SPIS students. I do a lot of hiking because I don't live too far away from Yosemite National Park, and I also enjoy reading books or watching shows/movies in my free time.
